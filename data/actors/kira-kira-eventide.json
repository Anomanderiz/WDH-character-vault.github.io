Just before the blade could fall and snuff out her life as well, Lethe appeared and incinerated one of the two would-be assassins with a blast of radiant fire while a house guard named Thrum took down the other.

She's flashy, rash, and haughty, but means well and truly cares about others. She believes in the power of love, beauty, and cuteness. She seems a bit desperate to prove herself.",
        "bond": "Kira cares deeply for her trusted friend and personal guard, Thrum. She would do anything to protect him, although in battle the roles are most likely reversed. It doesn't stop her from trying, though. He's basically both her brains and her brawn.\n\nShe grew up with Lethe and is deeply grateful (and feels quite guilty) for his sacrifice. She agrees with his mission and wants to restore him to power while fulfilling it in his stead.",
        "flaw": "She tends to speak without really thinking, and often runs headfirst into dangerous situations. Although she'll whine about it, she's grateful that Thrum reigns her in when this happens. She's very honest and easy to read, which makes her a terrible liar. Sooner or later, the truth about her background is going to come out, and hopefully it won't be to the wrong people. It's really obvious that she's not a farmer and is most likely a noble. Some may say she's compensating for something with her whole \"hero of light and justice\" schtick, or find it to be annoying.",

She's a bit obnoxious, but truly wants to be a force for good in the world. She desperately wants people to call her Kira✧Kira Eventide, but they probably won't so she'll begrudgingly accept Kira.

The information below details how you use those rules with Cleric spells, which appear on the Cleric spell list.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Cantrips.</em></strong> You know three cantrips of your choice from the Cleric spell list.</p>\n<p>Whenever you gain a Cleric level, you can replace one of your cantrips with another cantrip of your choice from the Cleric spell list.</p>\n<p>When you reach Cleric levels 4 and 10, you learn another cantrip of your choice from the Cleric spell list, as shown in the Cantrips column of the Cleric Features table.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Spell Slots.</em></strong> The Cleric Features table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your level 1+ spells. You regain all expended slots when you finish a Long Rest.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Prepared Spells of Level 1+.</em></strong> You prepare the list of level 1+ spells that are available for you to cast with this feature. To start, choose four level 1 spells from the Cleric spell list.</p>\n<p>The number of spells on your list increases as you gain Cleric levels, as shown in the Prepared Spells column of the Cleric Features table. Whenever that number increases, choose additional spells from the Cleric spell list until the number of spells on your list matches the number on the table. The chosen spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For example, if you’re a level 3 Cleric, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of levels 1 and 2 in any combination.</p>\n<p>If another Cleric feature gives you spells that you always have prepared, those spells don’t count against the number of spells you can prepare with this feature, but those spells otherwise count as Cleric spells for you.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Changing Your Prepared Spells.</em></strong> Whenever you finish a Long Rest, you can change your list of prepared spells, replacing any of the spells there with other Cleric spells for which you have spell slots.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Spellcasting Ability.</em></strong> Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your Cleric spells.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Spellcasting Focus.</em></strong> You can use a Holy Symbol as a Spellcasting Focus for your Cleric spells.</p>\n\n<p><b>@UUID[Compendium.world.ddb-waterdeep-adventures-ddb-classes.Item.98oxMxqSkukj7Dbt]{Level 1: Divine Order}</b></p>\n<p>You have dedicated yourself to one of the following sacred roles of your choice.</p>\n\n<p><b>@UUID[Compendium.world.ddb-waterdeep-adventures-ddb-classes.Item.AJT3GGy0cGTkb7cA]{Level 2: Channel Divinity}</b></p>\n<p>You can channel divine energy directly from the Outer Planes to fuel magical effects. You start with two such effects: Divine Spark and Turn Undead, each of which is described below. Each time you use this class’s Channel Divinity, choose which Channel Divinity effect from this class to create. You gain additional effect options at higher Cleric levels.</p>\n<p>You can use this class’s Channel Divinity twice. You regain one of its expended uses when you finish a Short Rest, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest. You gain additional uses when you reach certain Cleric levels, as shown in the Channel Divinity column of the Cleric Features table.</p>\n<p>If a Channel Divinity effect requires a saving throw, the DC equals the spell save DC from this class’s Spellcasting feature.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Divine Spark.</em></strong> As a Magic action, you point your Holy Symbol at another creature you can see within 30 feet of yourself and focus divine energy at it. Roll 1d8 and add your Wisdom modifier. You either restore Hit Points to the creature equal to that total or force the creature to make a [[/save con format=long]]. On a failed save, the creature takes Necrotic or Radiant damage (your choice) equal to that total. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage (round down).</p>\n<p>You roll an additional d8 when you reach Cleric levels 7 (2d8), 13 (3d8), and 18 (4d8).</p>\n<p><strong><em>Turn Undead.</em></strong> As a Magic action, you present your Holy Symbol and censure Undead creatures. Each Undead of your choice within 30 feet of you must make a [[/save wis format=long]]. If the creature fails its save, it has the &amp;Reference[frightened]{Frightened} and &amp;Reference[incapacitated]{Incapacitated} conditions for 1 minute. For that duration, it tries to move as far from you as it can on its turns. This effect ends early on the creature if it takes any damage, if you have the &amp;Reference[incapacitated]{Incapacitated} condition, or if you die.</p>\n\n<p><b>Level 3: Cleric Subclass</b></p>\n<p>You gain a Cleric subclass of your choice. A subclass is a specialization that grants you features at certain Cleric levels. For the rest of your career, you gain each of your subclass’s features that are of your Cleric level or lower.</p>\n\n<p><b>Level 4: Ability Score Improvement</b></p>\n<p>You gain the Ability Score Improvement feat or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. You gain this feature again at Cleric levels 8, 12, and 16.</p>\n\n<p><b>Level 5: Sear Undead</b></p>\n<p>Whenever you use Turn Undead, you can roll a number of d8s equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of 1d8) and add the rolls together. Each Undead that fails its saving throw against that use of Turn Undead takes Radiant damage equal to the roll’s total. This damage doesn’t end the turn effect.</p>\n\n<p><b>Level 7: Blessed Strikes</b></p>\n<p>Divine power infuses you in battle. You gain one of the following options of your choice (if you get either option from a Cleric subclass in an older book, use only the option you choose for this feature).</p>\n<p><strong><em>Divine Strike.</em></strong> Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with an attack roll using a weapon, you can cause the target to take an extra 1d8 Necrotic or Radiant damage (your choice).</p>\n<p><strong><em>Potent Spellcasting.</em></strong> Add your Wisdom modifier to the damage you deal with any Cleric cantrip.</p>\n\n<p><b>Level 8: Ability Score Improvement</b></p>\n<p>You gain the Ability Score Improvement feat or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. You gain this feature again at Cleric levels 12 and 16.</p>\n\n<p><b>Level 10: Divine Intervention</b></p>\n<p>You can call on your deity or pantheon to intervene on your behalf. As a Magic action, choose any Cleric spell of level 5 or lower that doesn’t require a Reaction to cast. As part of the same action, you cast that spell without expending a spell slot or needing Material components. You can’t use this feature again until you finish a Long Rest.</p>\n\n<p><b>Level 12: Ability Score Improvement</b></p>\n<p>You gain the Ability Score Improvement feat or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. You gain this feature again at Cleric level 16.</p>\n\n<p><b>Level 14: Improved Blessed Strikes</b></p>\n<p>The option you chose for Blessed Strikes grows more powerful.</p>\n\n<p><b>Level 16: Ability Score Improvement</b></p>\n<p>You gain the Ability Score Improvement feat or another feat of your choice for which you qualify.</p>\n\n<p><b>Level 19: Epic Boon</b></p>\n<p>You gain an Epic Boon feat or another feat of your choice for which you qualify.</p>\n\n<p><b>Level 20: Greater Divine Intervention</b></p>\n<p>You can call on even more powerful divine intervention. When you use your Divine Intervention feature, you can choose Wish when you select a spell. If you do so, you can’t use Divine Intervention again until you finish 2d4 Long Rests.</p>\n\n\n</div>",

You carry a noble title, and your family owns land, collects taxes, and wields significant political influence. You might be a pampered aristocrat unfamiliar with work or discomfort, a former merchant just elevated to the nobility, or a disinherited scoundrel with a disproportionate sense of entitlement. Or you could be an honest, hard-working landowner who cares deeply about the people who live and work on your land, keenly aware of your responsibility to them.</p><p>Work with your DM to come up with an appropriate title and determine how much authority that title carries. A noble title doesn’t stand on its own—it’s connected to an entire family, and whatever title you hold, you will pass it down to your own children. Not only do you need to determine your noble title, but you should also work with the DM to describe your family and their influence on you.</p> <p>Is your family old and established, or was your title only recently bestowed? How much influence do they wield, and over what area? What kind of reputation does your family have among the other aristocrats of the region? How do the common people regard them?</p> <p>What’s your position in the family? Are you the heir to the head of the family? Have you already inherited the title? How do you feel about that responsibility? Or are you so far down the line of inheritance that no one cares what you do, as long as you don’t embarrass the family? How does the head of your family feel about your adventuring career? Are you in your family’s good graces, or shunned by the rest of your family?</p> <p>Does your family have a coat of arms? An insignia you might wear on a signet ring? Particular colors you wear all the time? An animal you regard as a symbol of your line or even a spiritual member of the family?</p> <p>These details help establish your family and your title as features of the world of the campaign.</p><h3>Position of Privilege</h3><p>Thanks to your noble birth, people are inclined to think the best of you. You are welcome in high society, and people assume you have the right to be wherever you are. The common folk make every effort to accommodate you and avoid your displeasure, and other people of high birth treat you as a member of the same social sphere. You can secure an audience with a local noble if you need to.</p><h3>Proficiencies</h3><ul></ul>\n</div>\n</div>",

Appearing in an unoccupied space within range, the familiar has the statistics of the chosen form, though it is a Celestial, Fey, or Fiend (your choice) instead of a Beast. Your familiar acts independently of you, but it obeys your commands.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Telepathic Connection.</em></strong> While your familiar is within 100 feet of you, you can communicate with it telepathically. Additionally, as a Bonus Action, you can see through the familiar’s eyes and hear what it hears until the start of your next turn, gaining the benefits of any special senses it has.</p>\n<p>Finally, when you cast a spell with a range of touch, your familiar can deliver the touch. Your familiar must be within 100 feet of you, and it must take a Reaction to deliver the touch when you cast the spell.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Combat.</em></strong> The familiar is an ally to you and your allies. It rolls its own Initiative and acts on its own turn. A familiar can’t attack, but it can take other actions as normal.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Disappearance of the Familiar.</em></strong> When the familiar drops to 0 Hit Points, it disappears. It reappears after you cast this spell again. As a Magic action, you can temporarily dismiss the familiar to a pocket dimension. Alternatively, you can dismiss it forever. As a Magic action while it is temporarily dismissed, you can cause it to reappear in an unoccupied space within 30 feet of you. Whenever the familiar drops to 0 Hit Points or disappears into the pocket dimension, it leaves behind in its space anything it was wearing or carrying.</p>\n<p><strong><em>One Familiar Only.</em></strong> You can’t have more than one familiar at a time. If you cast this spell while you have a familiar, you instead cause it to adopt a new eligible form.</p>\n</div>",

You start with two such effects: Divine Spark and Turn Undead, each of which is described below. Each time you use this class’s Channel Divinity, choose which Channel Divinity effect from this class to create. You gain additional effect options at higher Cleric levels.</p>\n<p>You can use this class’s Channel Divinity twice. You regain one of its expended uses when you finish a Short Rest, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest. You gain additional uses when you reach certain Cleric levels, as shown in the Channel Divinity column of the Cleric Features table.</p>\n<p>If a Channel Divinity effect requires a saving throw, the DC equals the spell save DC from this class’s Spellcasting feature.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Divine Spark.</em></strong> As a Magic action, you point your Holy Symbol at another creature you can see within 30 feet of yourself and focus divine energy at it. Roll 1d8 and add your Wisdom modifier. You either restore Hit Points to the creature equal to that total or force the creature to make a [[/save con format=long]]. On a failed save, the creature takes Necrotic or Radiant damage (your choice) equal to that total. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage (round down).</p>\n<p>You roll an additional d8 when you reach Cleric levels 7 (2d8), 13 (3d8), and 18 (4d8).</p>\n<p><strong><em>Turn Undead.</em></strong> As a Magic action, you present your Holy Symbol and censure Undead creatures. Each Undead of your choice within 30 feet of you must make a [[/save wis format=long]]. If the creature fails its save, it has the &amp;Reference[frightened]{Frightened} and &amp;Reference[incapacitated]{Incapacitated} conditions for 1 minute. For that duration, it tries to move as far from you as it can on its turns. This effect ends early on the creature if it takes any damage, if you have the &amp;Reference[incapacitated]{Incapacitated} condition, or if you die.</p>\n</div>\n</div>",

Appearing in an unoccupied space within range, the familiar has the statistics of the chosen form, though it is a Celestial, Fey, or Fiend (your choice) instead of a Beast. Your familiar acts independently of you, but it obeys your commands.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Telepathic Connection.</em></strong> While your familiar is within 100 feet of you, you can communicate with it telepathically. Additionally, as a Bonus Action, you can see through the familiar’s eyes and hear what it hears until the start of your next turn, gaining the benefits of any special senses it has.</p>\n<p>Finally, when you cast a spell with a range of touch, your familiar can deliver the touch. Your familiar must be within 100 feet of you, and it must take a Reaction to deliver the touch when you cast the spell.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Combat.</em></strong> The familiar is an ally to you and your allies. It rolls its own Initiative and acts on its own turn. A familiar can’t attack, but it can take other actions as normal.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Disappearance of the Familiar.</em></strong> When the familiar drops to 0 Hit Points, it disappears. It reappears after you cast this spell again. As a Magic action, you can temporarily dismiss the familiar to a pocket dimension. Alternatively, you can dismiss it forever. As a Magic action while it is temporarily dismissed, you can cause it to reappear in an unoccupied space within 30 feet of you. Whenever the familiar drops to 0 Hit Points or disappears into the pocket dimension, it leaves behind in its space anything it was wearing or carrying.</p>\n<p><strong><em>One Familiar Only.</em></strong> You can’t have more than one familiar at a time. If you cast this spell while you have a familiar, you instead cause it to adopt a new eligible form.</p>\n</div>",

The sound continues unabated throughout the duration, or you can make discrete sounds at different times before the spell ends.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Image.</em></strong> If you create an image of an object—such as a chair, muddy footprints, or a small chest—it must be no larger than a 5-foot Cube. The image can’t create sound, light, smell, or any other sensory effect.

It only picks up materials it chooses to and can control whether or not it's wet to the touch. The <em>tea weird</em> can inhabit up to 1 gallon of water, or as little as 1 ounce.

It has a speed of 5 feet and can hover up to 5 feet off the ground. It has AC 10, 10 hit points, and has resistance to all damage. The <em>tea weird</em> regains all its hit points if given at least 1 ounce of water. Drinking the entire <em>tea weird</em> is harmless to you, but destroys the item.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Sentience.</strong></em> The <em>tea weird</em> is a sentient chaotic good item with an Intelligence of 3, a Wisdom of 8, and a Charisma of 6.

The Influence Checks table suggests which ability check to make based on how you’re interacting with the monster. The GM chooses the check, which has a default DC equal to 15 or the monster’s Intelligence score, whichever is higher. On a successful check, the monster does as urged. On a failed check, you must wait 24 hours (or a duration set by the DM) before urging it in the same way again.</p><table><caption>Influence Checks</caption><thead><tr><th><p>Ability Check</p></th><th><p>Interaction</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><p>[[/check dec]]</p></td><td><p>Deceiving a monster that understands you</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>[[/check itm]]</p></td><td><p>Intimidating a monster</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>[[/check prf]]</p></td><td><p>Amusing a monster</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>[[/check per]]</p></td><td><p>Persuading a monster that understands you</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>[[/check ani]]</p></td><td><p>Gently coaxing a Beast or Monstrosity</p></td></tr></tbody></table>",
